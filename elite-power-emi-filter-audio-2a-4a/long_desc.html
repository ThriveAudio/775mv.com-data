    This top quality, high efficiency filter is a perfect purifier of the power supplied to the high-end audio equipment.<br/>
    <br/>
    The filtering methodology and schematics have been approved by hundreds of audiophiles who have been using filters by MyElectrons since 2014. This is the third, improved generation of Power Line Filters for Audio by MyElectrons and Thrive!Audio.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Unrivaled level of EMI / noise suppression for high current power lines</b><br/>
    The filter deploys common mode transformers of a very high inductance available on the market for the specified load current. This ensures high efficiency of the <u>common-mode</u> EMI suppression.<br/>
    Two high inductance differential EMI filtering coils, combined with top grade metal film polypropylene capacitors form a very efficient barrier for the <u>differential</u> EMI / noise.<br/>
    Careful dampening of both common-mode and differential filtering circuits ensures <u>resonance-free</u>, quiet operation of the filter.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Ground Loop braking</b> is more <u>efficient</u> and <u>safer</u> than found in most other commercially available <i>Hum Suppressors / Eliminators</i>.<br/>
    Use of very powerful diodes provides for a safe system free of ground wire loops. Careful dampening of the ground loop breaker prevents any resonance effects. Current handling capacity of the grounding circuit is rated at more than 250A for 1s.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Zero Noise Overvoltage Protection</b><br/>
    Overvoltage protection is applied between the load and neutral lines. Both lines are fused. By protecting your equipment from overvoltage events that are unavoidable in any domestic or industrial power distribution networks the filter prevents ageing of the equipmentâ€™s internal EMI suppression subsystems.<br/>
    Overvoltage protection is a self-resetting, Zero Noise circuit, normally found in high-end measurement equipment. This circuit also prevents aging of the MOV, providing for the unprecedented reliability of the design.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>High efficiency Power and Phase Indicator</b>,  is a simple yet useful addition to the power line filters by Thrive!Audio and MyElectrons. It ensures the correct phasing and grounding of the equipment that guarantees the optimal noise suppression. The indicator, and hence the whole filter, consumes less than 0.1W of power.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Elite grade parts</b><br/>
    Capacitors by WIMA, renowned by the audiophile society. Top quality inductors by J.W.Miller, Bourns and Kemet. Low impedance fuses by Littelfuse. PCBs for the Elite version are made with <u>Double Copper</u> thickness for feeding your equipment with the most transparent and direct, yet well filtered power.
