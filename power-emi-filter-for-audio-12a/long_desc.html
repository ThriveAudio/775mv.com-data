  The 12A-MKII is a high current, high efficiency filter that is a perfect fit for an egress filter in an advanced power conditioner. It also serves very well as a standalone filter for high power loads, such as <i>Vacuum Tube Amplifiers</i>, high power <i>Class A Amplifiers</i>, etc. Due to its extremely low impedance at low frequencies and advanced filtering and ground loop braking techniques this filter provides <u>clean power for the most dynamic sound reproduction</u>.<br/>
<br/>
The filtering methodology and schematics have been approved by hundreds of audiophiles who have been using filters by MyElectrons as from the year 2014. The Elite+ series builds upon the third, improved generation of Power Line Filters for Audio by MyElectrons and Thrive Audio. Mark II gets boost in the depth of RF noise suppression by its extra stage of filtration – it is a 9th order filter.<br/>
<br/>
For the optimal EMI and Noise Suppression the load current of this variant of the filter should be less than 12A RMS. The filter can sustain up to 16A RMS of the load indefinitely.<br/>
<br/>
Unrivaled level of EMI / noise suppression for high current power lines<br/>
The filter deploys common-mode transformers of the highest inductance value practically available on the market for the specified load current. This ensures high efficiency of the common-mode EMI suppression.
Two RF and two high inductance differential EMI filtering coils, combined with top grade metal film polypropylene capacitors, form a very efficient barrier for the differential EMI / noise.
Careful dampening of both common-mode and differential filtering circuits ensures resonance-free, quiet operation of the filter.

Ground Loop braking is more efficient and safer than found in most commercially available Hum Suppressor / Eliminator competitors products.
Use of a custom-built Ground Wire Choke provides for a system free of high frequency ground wire loops. Careful dampening of the choke prevents resonance effects. Current handling capacity of the grounding circuit is rated at more than 250A for 1s.

Zero Noise Surge Protection
Surge / overvoltage protection is applied between the load and neutral lines. Both lines are fused.
The Thrive Audio’ signature self-resetting, Zero Noise surge protection circuit is a novelty in power line filtration and protection technology. An overvoltage protection solution of a comparable quality can be found in high-end  professional measurement equipment.

High efficiency Power and Phase Indicator, an elegant and very power efficient solution that can be found in power line filters by Thrive Audio and MyElectrons. The indicator, and hence the whole filter, consumes less than 0.1W of active power.
