    The Elite++ 30A is a high current, high efficiency filter. It can cover a complete household power line up to 25A. Elite++ 30A is a perfect fit for an egress filter in an advanced power conditioner. It can also serve very well as a standalone filter for very high power loads, such as BIG <i>Vacuum Tube Amplifiers</i>, VERY HIGH Power Class A Amplifiers, etc. Due to its extremely low impedance at low frequencies and advanced filtering and ground loop braking techniques this filter provides <u>clean power for the most dynamic sound reproduction</u>.<br/>
    <br/>
    The filtering methodology and schematics have been approved by hundreds of audiophiles who have been using filters by MyElectrons as from the year 2014. The Elite++ series builds upon the third, improved generation of Power Line Filters for Audio by MyElectrons and Thrive Audio. 30A version gets boost in the RF noise suppression by the additional stage of filtration: It is a 9th order filter.<br/>
    <br/>
    For the optimal EMI and Noise Suppression the recommended load current for this filter is 25A RMS or lower. The filter can sustain up to 33A RMS of the load indefinitely and still provide a stellar level of suppression of all sorts of nuisances in the power line.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Unrivaled level of EMI / noise suppression for high current power lines</b><br/>
    The filter deploys common-mode transformers of the highest inductance value practically available on the market for the specified load current. This ensures high efficiency of the <u>common-mode</u> EMI suppression.<br/>
    Two RF and two high inductance differential EMI filtering coils, combined with top grade metal film polypropylene capacitors, form a very efficient barrier for the <u>differential</u> EMI / noise.<br/>
    Careful dampening of both common-mode and differential filtering circuits ensures <u>resonance-free</u>, quiet operation of the filter.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Ground Loop braking</b> is more <u>efficient</u> and <u>safer</u> than found in most commercially available <i>Hum Suppressor / Eliminator</i> competitors products.<br/>
    Use of a custom-built Ground Wire Choke provides for a system free of high frequency ground wire loops. Careful dampening of the choke prevents resonance effects. Current handling capacity of the grounding circuit is rated at more than 750A for 1s.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Zero Noise Surge Protection</b><br/>
    Surge protection is applied between load and neutral lines. This filter is unfused for maintaining the unprecedently low impedance.<br/>
    The Thrive Audioâ€™ signature <u>self-resetting</u>, <u>Zero Noise</u> surge protection circuit is a novelty in power line filtration technology. An overvoltage protection solution of a comparable quality can be found in high-end professional measurement equipment.<br/>
    <br/>
    <b>High efficiency Power Indicator</b>, and hence the whole filter, consumes less than 0.1W of power.<br/>
